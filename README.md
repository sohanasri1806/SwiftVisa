# SwiftVisa – LLM-Powered RAG-Based Visa Eligibility Assistant

## Project Overview
**SwiftVisa** is an **LLM-powered, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system** that helps users determine their eligibility for various UK visa types.  
It provides **policy-grounded, point-wise eligibility responses** based entirely on official government documents, without relying on rule-based systems, scraping, or translation APIs.  

The system combines **PDF document processing, vector embeddings, RAG-based retrieval, and a Streamlit interface** to guide users through visa eligibility assessment.

## Supported UK Visa Types
SwiftVisa currently supports five UK visa categories:  
1. **Student Visa**  
2. **Graduate Visa**  
3. **Health and Care Worker Visa**  
4. **Skilled Worker Visa**  
5. **Standard Visitor Visa**

## Project Workflow
1. **Policy Document Collection:**  
   - Collected official UK visa eligibility documents from gov.uk.  

2. **Text Extraction:**  
   - Extracted text from PDFs using **PDFPlumber**.  

3. **Text Cleaning & Formatting:**  
   - Removed unnecessary characters, merged lines, and structured headings.  

4. **Embedding Generation:**  
   - Converted cleaned text into **vector embeddings** using **SentenceTransformers**.  
   - Stored embeddings in **ChromaDB** for fast retrieval.

5. **RAG Query Test:**  
   - User queries are converted into embeddings.  
   - Relevant document chunks are retrieved from the vector store.  
   - Answers are generated using an **LLM**, grounded in retrieved policy documents.

6. **Streamlit Application:**
   Initially user is asked to select their desired visa type.
   - **Stage 1:** Collect visa type and personal, contact, and passport details.  
   - **Stage 2:** Collect user journey details.  
   - **Stage 3:** Collect visa-specific eligibility details.  
   - **Stage 4:** Review and edit details before submission.  
   - **Eligibility Result:**  
     - **Eligible:** Badge, confidence score, detailed explanation, document checklist, next steps, dos and don’ts, future visa options.  
     - **Not Eligible:** Badge, confidence score, explanation of unmet requirements, guidance on how to meet requirements.
